Home Lab is temporarily complete.
Here is what was added / changed / what is in-use:
- Slightly messed up and had to re-download ParrotOS as I downloaded the virtual disk file instead of the .iso. Using "Security"
- The virtual disk file would have worked, but the .iso was an easier setup for my usage
- Got ParrotOS installed
- Installed and using VMware
- Using OpenVPN
