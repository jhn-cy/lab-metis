### Documentation and progress tracking for my home lab. See the README for detailed background and project info. 

//Update 10-12-2025
#### My Background
Outside of _very basic_ Windows and Linux command-line and file hierarchy work as well as general usage for both operating systems, I am starting from scratch. 

#### My Why
This home lab is intended for use for Hack The Box (HTB) labs as I go from the rank of "Noob" to "Hacker" (and beyond). 
This is **also** my introduction into not only home labbing, but HTB labs, cybersecurity labs, and really anything to do with practical work for IT/InfoSec/Cyber. 
I want to be great at this and land a job in the space - so I am practicing / working to become great and accomplish the latter. 

# Lab Details / Specs
I am using two laptops for this - details below this section.


#### Computer Details / Specs
Here are the details for my laptops:
- Using 2 laptops because I upgrade my laptop for more RAM and kept my "old" one
  - The laptops: 2024 ASUS Zephyrus G16 and 2020 ASUS Zephyrus G14
    - G16 specs: 32gb RAM, Ultra 9 Processor, 4080 (mobile-crippled), 1TB SSD and an extra 500GB SSD that currently holds Fedora but will likely change to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
    - G14 specs: 16gb RAM, AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 9 4900HS, 2060 (mobile-crippled). 1TB SSD that just holds the home lab
