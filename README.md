### Documentation and progress tracking for my home lab.

// Update 10-12-2025
#### My Background
Outside of _very basic_ Windows and Linux command-line work as well as general usage for both operating systems, I am "practically" starting from scratch. 
I have two certifications: A+ and Security+ and am pursuing a BSCS as well as a few more certifications that will be added here once acquired.

# Lab Details
- VMWare with ParrotOS Security Edition (comes with most standard tools you'd want / need for lab work - I grabbed a few more as well)
- OpenVPN

## Updating and Using GitHub as a "blog"
This README will be for HTB Labs / HTB CDSA Progress. 
I will provide home-lab updates here as well.
I will likely add pages / READMEs for write-ups on Malware Reverse-Engineering, books and certifications when I cross those bridges. The work load right now is rather heavy, so I'm checking things off as I go.
