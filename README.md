# Home Lab Documentation & Progress Tracking
### My Background
I am "practically" starting from scratch. 
I've used Windows for 5+ years and have used Linux for around 6 months. I have not done a deep-dive into the internal workings of _either_.

I have two certifications: A+ and Security+ and am pursuing a BSCS as well as a few more certifications that will be added here once acquired.

## Lab Details
- VMWare with ParrotOS Security Edition
- OpenVPN

## Updating and Using GitHub as a "blog"
This README will be for HTB Labs / HTB CDSA Progress. 
I will provide home-lab updates here as well.
I will likely add pages / READMEs for write-ups on Malware Reverse-Engineering, books and certifications when I cross those bridges. The work load right now is rather heavy, so I'm checking things off as I go.
